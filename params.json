(Want to use ESLint instead? Try the [javascript-eslint.tmbundle](https://github.com/natesilva/javascript-eslint.tmbundle).)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 1](https://raw.github.com/natesilva/jshint-external.tmbundle/master/no-errors.png)\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Validate automatically when you save your file, and on-demand.\r\n* Intelligently uses `.jshintrc` settings, whether stored in the same directory tree as your source file, in your home directory, or referenced from a `package.json` file.\r\n* Uses a separately-installed copy of `jshint`.\r\n    * Does not include a bundled (possibly outdated) copy of JSHint.\r\n    * Fewer dependency problems.\r\n* Common error codes include a link to the relevant explanation on [jslinterrors.com](http://jslinterrors.com/).\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2](https://raw.github.com/natesilva/jshint-external.tmbundle/master/with-errors.png)\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nIf you don’t have JSHint, install it:\r\n\r\n1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).\r\n2. `[sudo] npm install -g jshint`\r\n\r\nNow install the bundle:\r\n\r\n1. [Download the latest release .zip file](https://github.com/natesilva/jshint-external.tmbundle/releases/latest).\r\n2. Extract it and double-click to install.\r\n\r\n## Release Notes\r\n\r\nRelease notes are found in the [Releases](https://github.com/natesilva/jshint-external.tmbundle/releases) section of this GitHub repo.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nIn most cases no configuration is required. However, in some cases you may want to customize the following:\r\n\r\n* **Use `jshint` that is not on your `PATH`:** If `jshint` is not on your `PATH`, set the `TM_JSHINT_EXTERNAL_JSHINT` variable to point to it. Set in *TextMate* > *Preferences…* > *Variables*.\r\n* **Don’t validate on save:** If you don’t want to validate your JavaScript automatically when you press `⌘S`:\r\n    1. Open the Bundle Editor (*Bundles* > *Edit Bundles…*).\r\n    2. Navigate to *JSHint (External)* > *Menu Actions* > *Save & Validate with JSHint*.\r\n    3. In the drawer that appears, delete the “Key Equivalent” of `⌘S`.\r\n* **Use a project-specific JSHint configuration:**\r\n    * **For Node.js:** Add a key called `jsonHintConfig` to the `package.json` file. This key should contain the filename of your JSHint configuration file ([JSHint config syntax](http://www.jshint.com/docs/)).\r\n    * **For any JavaScript project:** Create a `.jshintrc` file ([syntax](http://www.jshint.com/docs/)). Place it in your source directory or any directory above it.\r\n\r\n## Uninstall\r\n\r\n1. Quit TextMate.\r\n2. Open `~/Library/Application Support/Avian/Pristine Copy/Bundles`.\r\n3. Trash `jshint-external.tmbundle`.\r\n4. Open `~/Library/Application Support/Avian/Bundles`.\r\n5. If there is a file called `JavaScript JSHint (External).tmbundle`, trash it.\r\n6. You may need to clear TextMate’s cache by trashing `~/Library/Caches/com.macromates.TextMate.preview`.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
